**burger-api** is a modern, open source API framework built on [Bun.js](https://bun.sh). It combines the simplicity of file-based routing with powerful features like built-in middleware, Zod-based schema validation, and automatic OpenAPI generation. Designed for high performance and ease-of-use, burger-api leverages Bun's native modules to deliver blazing-fast API responses while keeping your codebase clean and maintainable.

**This project is under active development and should not be used in production yet.**

## 🚀 Overview

burger-api is built to offer a robust developer experience through:

- ⚡ **Bun-Native Performance:**  
  Leverages Bun's high-performance HTTP server.

- 📁 **File-Based Routing:**  
  Automatically registers API routes from your file structure using a clear naming convention.

- 🔄 **Middleware Architecture:**  
  Supports both global and route-specific middleware with a familiar `req, res, next` pattern.

- ✅ **Type-Safe Validation:**  
  Utilizes Zod for request validation, ensuring full type safety and automatic error reporting.

- 📚 **Automatic OpenAPI Generation:**  
  Generates a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification (with support for tags, summaries, descriptions, operationId, deprecated status, externalDocs, and more) directly from your routes and Zod schemas.

- 🔍 **Swagger UI Integration:**  
  Provides an out-of-the-box Swagger UI endpoint for interactive API documentation.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features

- ⚡ **Bun-Native HTTP Server:**  
  Built on Bun's native APIs for exceptional performance.

- 📁 **File-Based Routing Engine:**  
  Automatically scans directories to register routes.

  - Supports dynamic routes via folder names like `[id]` for `/api/product/:id`.

- 🛠️ **Request & Response Enhancements:**

  - `BurgerRequest` extends the native Request to include query, params, and validated data.
  - `BurgerResponse` provides methods to set headers, status, and build responses (JSON, text, HTML, redirects, files).

- 🔄 **Middleware System:**

  - **Global Middleware:** Runs on every request.
  - **Route-Specific Middleware:** Defined in individual route files.
  - **Validation Middleware:** Automatically validates request data using Zod schemas exported from routes.

- ✅ **Zod-Based Schema Validation:**  
  Automatically validates request params, query, and body using Zod.

  - Supports preprocessing (e.g., converting URL parameters from string to number).

- 📚 **Automatic OpenAPI Specification Generation:**  
  Generates an OpenAPI 3.0 document using route metadata and Zod schemas.

  - **OpenAPI Options:**
    - Global metadata (title, description, version)
    - Per-route metadata (summary, description, tags, operationId, deprecated, externalDocs)
    - Auto-generated parameters and requestBody schemas (using `zod-to-json-schema` for detailed inline JSON schema definitions)

- 🔍 **Swagger UI Integration:**  
  Provides a `/docs` endpoint serving an interactive Swagger UI that reads from `/openapi.json`.

## 🎯 What's Coming Next?

We're enhancing burger-api to make it even more powerful! While our core focus remains on building fast, type-safe APIs, we're adding the ability to serve simple pages when needed:

### 🎨 Simple Page Serving (Coming Soon!)
- Optional page serving capability for simple views
- Perfect for API documentation, admin panels, or simple dashboards
- Not meant to replace full-stack frameworks like Next.js
- For complex frontend applications, we recommend using dedicated frontend frameworks

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to build and improve burger-api! We're committed to making it the best API framework for Bun.js.

## 📦 Installation

Install burger-api via bun:

```bash
bun add burger-api
```

## 🚀 How to Use burger-api

### **Basic Usage Example**

```ts
import { Burger } from "burger-api";

// Global middleware example: a simple logger.
const globalLogger = async (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`[Global Logger] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  return next();
};

const burger = new Burger({
  title: "My Custom API",
  description: "Custom API with auto-generated docs and validation",
  apiDir: "api",
  globalMiddleware: [globalLogger],
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Start the server on port 4000 with a callback
burger.serve(4000, (port) => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### **File-Based Routing Examples**

- 📄 **Static API Route:**  
  Place a file at `src/api/route.ts` to handle the root API endpoint (e.g., `/api`).

- 🔄 **Dynamic API Route:**  
  For routes with dynamic segments, create folders with square brackets. For example:
  ```
  src/api/product/
  ├── route.ts         // Handles /api/product
  └── [id]/
      └── route.ts     // Handles /api/product/:id
  ```

### **Route File Example**

Below is an example route file demonstrating schema validation, route-specific middleware, and OpenAPI metadata.

```ts
// examples/demo/api/product/[id]/route.ts

import { z } from "zod";
import type { BurgerRequest, BurgerResponse } from "burger-api";

// OpenAPI metadata for this route
export const openapi = {
  get: {
    summary: "Get Product Details",
    description: "Retrieves product details by product ID.",
    tags: ["Product"],
    operationId: "getProductDetails",
  },
};

// Validation Schemas for GET and POST requests
export const schema = {
  get: {
    params: z.object({
      id: z.preprocess(
        (val) => (typeof val === "string" ? parseInt(val, 10) : val),
        z.number().min(1, "ID is required")
      ),
    }),
    query: z.object({
      search: z.string().optional(),
    }),
  },
  post: {
    body: z.object({
      name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
      price: z.number().positive("Price must be positive"),
    }),
  },
};

// Route-specific middleware
export const middleware = [
  async (
    req: BurgerRequest,
    res: BurgerResponse,
    next: () => Promise<Response>
  ) => {
    console.log("[Product Middleware] Executing product route middleware");
    return next();
  },
];

// GET handler: returns product details
export async function GET(
  req: BurgerRequest,
  res: BurgerResponse,
  params: { id: number }
) {
  console.log("[GET] Product route invoked");
  const validatedParams = (req.validated?.params as { id: number }) || params;
  const query = req.validated?.query || Object.fromEntries(req.query.entries());
  return res.json({
    id: validatedParams.id,
    query,
    name: "Sample Product",
  });
}

// POST handler: creates a new product
export async function POST(req: BurgerRequest, res: BurgerResponse) {
  console.log("[POST] Product route invoked");
  const body = req.validated?.body || (await req.json());
  return res.json(body);
}
```

## ❓ FAQs & Additional Resources

- 🔄 **How do I add custom middleware?**  
  You can pass an array of global middleware in the Burger options or export route-specific middleware in your route files.

- 📁 **How does file-based routing work?**  
  Place your route files under `src/api/` or just `/api` using folder and file naming conventions (e.g., `[id]` for dynamic routes).

- ✅ **How is validation handled?**  
  burger-api uses Zod for schema validation. Define your schemas in your route files and they are automatically used to validate incoming requests.

- 📚 **How can I customize the OpenAPI documentation?**  
  Override the default auto-generated summaries, descriptions, tags, and operationIds by exporting an `openapi` object in your route files.

_burger-api_ aims to revolutionize your API development experience with simplicity, speed, and cutting-edge features. Happy coding! 🚀
